**SEO AUDIT ISSUES AND CORRECTION STRATEGIES**

**ISSUE 1: COMPLETE CONTENT RENDERING FAILURE**
Current state: Site displays only "Edit with ×" instead of actual content
Impact: 0% indexability - Content completely inaccessible to search engine crawlers
Root cause: Total JavaScript dependency without HTML fallbacks
Strategy:
- Immediate: Check server logs and CDN configuration
- Verify JavaScript console errors across browsers

- Add static content for critical pages
- Test rendering with JavaScript disabled
Priority: CRITICAL
Implementation time: 2-3 days for temporary fix

**ISSUE 2: DEFECTIVE FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE**
Current state: Single Page Application without Server-Side Rendering
Impact: Search bots cannot execute JavaScript to access content
Root cause: Base HTML contains no structured content
Strategy:
- Migrate to Next.js or similar SSR framework
- Implement getServerSideProps for dynamic content
- Use getStaticProps for static content generation
- Configure proper hydration for client-side interactivity
- Set up incremental static regeneration for updates
Priority: CRITICAL
Implementation time: 1-2 weeks

**ISSUE 3: INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS**
Current state: Possible CDN or server configuration issues
Impact: Content fails to load on multiple access attempts
Root cause: Misconfigured hosting, DNS, or CDN settings
